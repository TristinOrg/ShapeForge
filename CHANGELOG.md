# Changelog

All notable repository-level changes are documented here. Package-specific details are available in each package's `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Deterministic, category-neutral reference-image preprocessing for characters, buildings, props, vehicles, and other assets.
- A versioned reference-blueprint contract, validator, JSON Schema, and explicit low-confidence review queue.
- A resumable reference pipeline with provenance-aware review and an explicit category-compiler handoff.
- High-fidelity sheet evidence for top/bottom views, local details, diagrams, text regions, and labeled palette overrides.
- Provider-free offline inverse modeling with staged parameter discovery, multi-view render scoring, rollback, invalid-candidate isolation, convergence limits, and resumable evaluation artifacts.
- GLB 2.0 structural validation with optional external validator execution and machine-readable reports.
- Auditable FBX/USD converter profiles that pin tool identity, version, license, formats, and command.
- Curated reference-reconstruction corpus benchmarks with thresholds and aggregated failure modes.

### Removed

- The legacy Fantasy Hero, Humanoid Hero, Stylized Human, and Noctis Chibi experiment implementations.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Engine-agnostic Shape, Style, Reference, and Rig schemas.
- Core validation, fluent authoring, capabilities, templates, style inheritance, and complexity limits.
- Unity JSON, hierarchy, appearance, binding, prepared-plan, batch, and safe-regeneration workflows.
- Eleven Low Poly geometry capabilities with shared mesh and material caches.
- Stylized Human semantic compilation and generic multi-view Profile Cage mapping.
- Robot, Fantasy Hero, Inventor Workbench, Japanese Town, and Shibuya Crossing presets.
- Transform-based motion integration examples and semantic joint constraints.
- Repository release-contract validation through GitHub Actions.

### Removed

- The experimental character-specific LLM reference pipeline, replaced by generic reference contracts and mapping.
