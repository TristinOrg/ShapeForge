# Unity Project Context

<!-- unity-onboarding:generated:start -->

## Project Summary

- Last analyzed commit: `ef20d77`

## Confirmed Environment

- Unity version: 2022.3.62f3
- Render pipeline: Built-in Render Pipeline
- Input system: legacy Input Manager
- Target platforms: not yet defined

## Important Packages And Frameworks

| Area | Finding | Confidence | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tests | Unity Test Framework 1.1.33 | Confirmed | `Packages/packages-lock.json` |
| Rendering | No SRP package or configured render pipeline | Confirmed | `Packages/manifest.json`, `ProjectSettings/GraphicsSettings.asset` |
| Networking | No networking framework detected | Confirmed | `Packages/manifest.json` |

## Directory Structure

| Path | Purpose | Confidence | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Assets/Scenes` | Default Unity sample scene | Confirmed | repository files |
| `Packages/com.shapeforge.core` | Engine-neutral validation and style resolution | Confirmed | package manifest |
| `Packages/com.shapeforge.schema` | Engine-agnostic versioned data contracts | Confirmed | package manifest |
| `Packages/com.shapeforge.unity` | Unity generation and reference JSON adapter | Confirmed | package manifest |
| `Packages/com.shapeforge.lowpoly` | Official Low Poly implementation | Confirmed | package manifest |
| `Docs/AI` | Concise persistent project context | Confirmed | this document |

## Assembly Boundaries

Schema and Core use assemblies with no UnityEngine references. Unity adapts Schema/Core to GameObjects and JSON. LowPoly references the Unity Adapter; dependencies remain one-directional.

## Scenes And Startup Flow

- Build scenes: none enabled.
- Likely startup scene: unknown; `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity` exists but is not in Build Settings.
- Scene loading flow: none implemented.

## Architecture

Schema provides versioned engine-agnostic shape and style documents with optional base-style references, published Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema contracts, independent profile-cage sections, and minimal external-tool examples. Core provides validation, cached style inheritance, fluent authoring, engine-neutral transform contracts, backend-independent shape capabilities, and generic semantic-template compilation/discovery without UnityEngine. The Unity Adapter owns JSON, validated generic specification serialization, GameObject generation, lifecycle-safe appearance, discovery export, and stable transform resolution. LowPoly supplies a cached eleven-shape capability catalog including independent profile cages with bounded interpolated rings, the first versioned Stylized Human semantic compiler, generic normalized reference-to-cage mapping, reusable generation pipelines, cached geometry, modern and traditional environment presets, and undoable Editor preview commands.

## Coding Conventions

- Follow `C:/Users/Administrator/.codex/PREFERENCES.md` and `.editorconfig`.
- Use English comments and concise XML documentation for public APIs.
- Keep runtime and editor assemblies separate.

## Testing And Validation

- Unity Test Framework is installed.
- First-party EditMode tests cover fluent authoring, published JSON contracts, extraction guidance, cached style inheritance, validated capability and semantic-template discovery/export, generic reference mapping, runtime generation, prepared count- and time-budgeted batches, hierarchy adaptation, validation, lifecycle-safe appearance, shared render resources, procedural geometry including independent profile cages, remaining presets, and motion-ready pivots.
- `ShapeForge > Diagnostics > Benchmark JSON Generation` measures 200 alternating Table and Robot JSON generations, managed heap growth, and shared render-resource counts without saving generated objects.
- The benchmark reports JSON parsing and prepared-definition generation separately. Repeated runtime models should call `LowPolyModelGenerator.ParseJson` once and reuse the validated definition.
- Prepared batches use `UnityShapeGenerationPlan` to validate an immutable definition once before repeated generation.
- `LowPolyGenerationBatch` supports explicit model-count and elapsed-time step budgets without coroutines or global scheduling state.
- GitHub Actions validates package versions and dependencies, JSON syntax, release-pinned Schema IDs, required `.meta` files, release documents, and the Schema/Core engine boundary without requiring a Unity license.
- The `v0.1.0` release baseline passed all 77 EditMode tests in an isolated Unity 2022.3.62f3 project. No first-party PlayMode or player-build suite exists because ShapeForge currently ships packages rather than a player application.

## Available Unity Tooling

- Repository and Git CLI access: available.
- Unity MCP and live Editor inspection: available through CoplayDev Unity MCP 10.1.0.
- Unity Editor-generated C# projects exist, but no first-party code exists to compile.

## Important Constraints

- Shape is the smallest public modelling concept.
- Geometry, appearance, style, and animation data must remain extensible.
- Low Poly is an implementation package, not a Core dependency.
- External AI produces validated definitions and is not a Core dependency.
- Preserve generated node hierarchy for editing and pivot animation.

## Unknowns And Confidence

- The initial API and Unity JSON serialization shape are implemented but remain pre-1.0 and may evolve.
- Motion clip serialization, additional asset-category templates, and automated reference landmark extraction remain design work.
- Supported Unity versions and public release license are not yet decided.
